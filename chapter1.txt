JEFF BEZOS SAVES THE DAY:



Once upon a time the fruitful kingdom of Amazon was filled with happy villagers turned to ruin after the EVIL UPS and FEDEX OGRES
attacked the village. 

But the amazing Amazon kingdom wasn't gonna fall because they had a brave king named Jeff Bezos.
With one sweep of his swift amazon delivery he quickly wiped out the Ogres, and saved the Kingdom.

And they lived happily ever after-


THE END.
