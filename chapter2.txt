THE BOY AND THE AMAZON PACKAGE:


Once upon a time there was a lonley amazon package that roamed the amazonian lands.
Nobody wanted to open the package because his parents had cheap items inside of their boxes.

But one day a lonley boy was sitting on the rocks and saw the amazon package crying by the bushes.
The boy asked what was wrong, and the package said, 
"Everyone is saying im worth 50 cents plus shipping 
but I want to prove to everyone I'm more."

The boy's tummy rumbled, and the amazon package was very hungry as well.  
"I have an idea!" the amazon package shouted.
"Maybe if you open my box there will be food for us to eat."
So the boy opened the box, but sadly there was no food.
There was DIAMOND BARS in the box!

The both of them leaped in joy, on their way to go sell the gold, and they became trillionares
and broke the entire global economy. (this was the medieval times)
leaving many homeless and their life in shambles.


THE END.
