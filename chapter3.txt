THE TALE OF THE EVIL FEDEX and UPS OGRES:



The Amazonians, Fedanexe, and the Upsations, ALL used to live in harmony in the Amazon kingdom.
Until the AMAZING Amazonians made a new law that Amazon employees pee breaks 
should be cut from 2 a day to 0 a day.

That made the EVIL Fedanexe and the Upsations ANGRY.
They dared to defy the AWESOME Jeff Bezos's laws, so they got BANISHED from the kingdom.

And all the village folk cheered.


THE END.
